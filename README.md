Resource adding utility for JobFoundry. Incomplete.

# To do

## Front end

* Improve UI for main page, form, and list. Could need large rewrites
* Arbitraty attributes for authors
* Multiple author support
* Editing of existing resources
* Link to back end
* Fix down arrow to show list of elements on tag selector

Non-essential:
* Remove select2 and use radio buttons & plain selects
* Tag input inside input box, backspace to remove

## Back end

* Design a basic REST API
* Talk to Matt about existing data structures and any modifications that would need to be made
    * 'link' -> 'url'
    * Keys & Values for paths, levels and media types for cleaner display
