    <p>Job Foundry organises learning by tasks, just like you do in real life with real work.</p>

    <p>On each task, you'll find the most useful examples, tools and helpful resources, so you can stop searching and start doing.</p>

    <h2>Productivity Guaranteed</h2>
    <hr>

    <p>You'll always find clear goals and actionable next steps. Tasks are ordered and grouped into your projects, like creating a website, a mobile app or a marketing campaign.</p>

    <p>From your project overview, you can see what tasks to do next so you can make real progress towards creating your next big thing.</p>

    <p>So instead of attending a lecture, reading a book, watching a video series and ploughing through content that you might apply bits of later that day… later that week… maybe months on -- try Job Foundry. Productivity guaranteed.</p>

    <h2>Learn What Really Matters</h2>
    <hr>

    <p>You don't "learn to code" on Job Foundry - you learn to do what you're working on right now. You choose what you need to learn and when you need to learn it.</p>

    <p>Yes, sometimes you need to study complex topics in detail, but you'll also be working towards achieving your own goals, not someone else's.</p>

    <h2>Only the most useful resources.</h2>
    <hr>

    <p>Search engines sort by relevance. Social sites sort by popularity. But what you need is world-class help sorted strictly by usefulness.</p>

    <p>Save hours cutting through buzz and clutter, and instead zone straight in what's proven to be helpful for your specific task by people before you.</p>

    <h2>Share and Collaborate<br> on Public or Private Projects</h2>

    <p>Just like real life, you can share and collaborate on tasks and projects.</p>

    <p>Invite your co-workers, your clients, your mentors and anyone else you like to leave comments, collaborate and share tasks.</p>

    <p>Keep your projects public for anyone too see, or private to yourself and select people only.</p>
